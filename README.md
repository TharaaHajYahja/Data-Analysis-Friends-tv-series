# Data Analysis: Friends tv series
This project was the final assignment for the Data Analysis course at Tel Aviv University.

I've used the FRIENDS package which conatains multiple datasets. The first one contains each line spooken in the series, who spoke the line and when (which season, episode, scene and utterance), and the second dataset I've used contains data about each episodes information.

I've tried to answer the question:
1. Is there a relationship between IMDB rating for each episode and it's views in the USA? - answered usin Linear Regression.
2. Do women talk more than men in the show? - answered using t-test.

My grade for this project was 95. the main problem with it is that the question I've asked is wether women talk more than men in the show, although when manipulating the data I've grouped the data by character and not by gender.

The project was written in R.
